#Installation
- Make sure you already have installed Python v3.13 and Sublime Text if you are new at Python
- Open main.py with Sublime Text and also cmd (run as admin if you want)
- Install all libraries I imported in the project to make sure you won't get any error about it
- The project will use voice system which you are using in your Windows.

- Note: this project will run perfectly on Windows and I'm not sure if it can run on Mac. It is just a simple AI, you can upgrade anything you want.
